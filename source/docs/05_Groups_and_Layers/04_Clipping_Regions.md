#HTML5 Canvas Clipping Functions with Konva

To draw things inside of clipping regions with Konva, we can set the `clip`
property of any container, including a group, a layer, or the stage.
Clipping regions are defined by an x, y, width, and height.  In this tutorial,
we'll draw blobs inside of a rectangular clipping region applied to a group.
