#HTML5 Canvas Set Fill with Konva

To fill a shape with Konva, we can set the fill property when we instantiate a shape, or we can use the `fill()` method.

Konva supports colors, patterns, linear gradients, and radial gradients.

Instructions: Mouseover each pentagon to change its fill.  You can also drag and drop the shapes.
